# SpiderNet: Network Topology Obfuscation

Welcome to SpiderNet, a project focused on network topology obfuscation. We utilize honeypot links and fine-grained algorithms to enhance network security. This project is published in *IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking* (bib information to be updated soon).

## Getting Started

SpiderNet is implemented using Python and Jupyter notebooks. Each `.ipynb` notebook contains two core components: 
1. Python code blocks
2. A running example for hands-on demonstration.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrossPointAttack/NTO.git
```
